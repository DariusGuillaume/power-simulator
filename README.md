# Powerball Simulator

A Python-based Powerball Simulator that animates the drawing of Powerball numbers using a graphical user interface (GUI).

## Description

The Powerball Simulator is a small project that mimics the drawing process of the Powerball lottery game. It randomly selects 5 white balls (numbered from 1 to 69) and 1 red ball (numbered from 1 to 26) and animates the selection process on a GUI window. The simulator provides a visual representation of the Powerball drawing, similar to what is seen on TV.
